# Javascript-Puzzle
```
This the repo for making the simple Javascript puzzles.

Consider every variables as a box.

If the variable is global consider the value is updated 


>>> Puzzle 1 :
Input -> There is 4 calls in a function
Expected Output -> Hello Mark , Hello William , Hello Mark

>>> Puzzle 2 :
Output -> 10 , 11 , 12

>>> Puzzle 3 :
Output -> 10 , 9 , 8

>>> Puzzle 4 :
Output -> 10 , 100 , 1000

>>> Puzzle 5 :
Output -> 9 ,8 ,7

be confusing to you and the browser if you
started using them for your variables.**
